# Alarian Empire (Place savegame inside of Documents/Egosoft/X4/389150302/save) (The numbered directory "389150302" may be different for you!)

Alarian Empire X4 Budgeted Start Save-game (NOT MODIFIED) (4.7 Billion Networth) (Time Spent in SETA: 202 Minutes) (Gamesave hours without SETA: 45)

With a massive economy already developed and under your command... and the foundations of another ready to be built upon... can YOU
lead the Alarian Empire and save the X4 Universe from the ever expanding Xenon threat? The Xenon were thought to be under the control of the Terran Intervention Forces with the aid of the ever expanding Alarian economy; they have failed. The Xenon have successfully invaded Hatikva's Choice in-force and are on track to completely take over the sector if we do not send aid immediately. This is only the beginning... we have no intelligence of the other Xenon home sectors... are the Xenon invading across the universe? What are we to do?


- Massive budgeted start built economy in TER space (Juipter and the Asteroid Belt + a Solar Supply Station in Mercury). (PS Failed-Order ships are STILL working! Check Behavior.)

- Homestation is equipped with a Wharf, XL Dock, and Repair Wharf. The empire is capable of producing Alarian ships SOLELY off of Alarian outputs alone... do not underestimate our own economy! (Alaria is in possession of numerous BP's to bolster our fleet but we still need to expand our currently available BP's!)

- Foundation for another economy ready to be built upon in PIO space.

- ARG is under attack from the Xenon in Hatikva! THIS SECTOR CANNOT FALL! The rapid response forces of the Alarian, Argon, and Terran empires have been wiped out by the Xenon in hopes to aid the falling sector. The united fleets of the empires are in shambles... can you make do with the present forces at hand while Alaria rebuilds? (WARNING ROUTED ALARIAN FORCES IN HATIKVA WILL BE UNDER HEAVY ASSAULT WITHIN SECONDS OF LOADING THE SAVE. OUR FORCES WILL NOT LAST FOR MUCH LONGER IF IGNORED!)

- Alaria has built a hull part factory in Antigone Memorial in order to support the ARG frontline deployment.

- TER has lost the defense of Savage Spur II... the gates of SSII are now under heavy TER patrol but Xenon are slipping through and annihilating our resources! Khahak are consistnently raiding in the Asteroid Belt! What are we to do?

- ANT is under assault from HOP in the south... do we have intention to aid either of these empires?

- No contact has been made with the Split families... is it too late? 

- Alaria has possession of a Syn class destroyer and Asgard class battleship defending the main silicon carbide production station (The heart of the Alarian economy)
